ShortCircuit XT is a sample-initiated instrument being actively developed by the Surge Synth Team. The build below is our latest alpha github version, but it is very incomplete.

The instrument has many features incomplete, still has unresolved crashing bugs, and may have DSP errors which cause unbounded sound. Still, it is becoming more stable and usable and we do have testers and developers running it.

If you use ShortCircuit a few things of note:

- You may want to use a limiter on the SC bus, in case there is a DSP error, and definitely do not use in-ear headphones
- Most of the discussion about what works and doesn't happens on our discord. Please join!

  serves as a design guide for where we are going
- The more the merrier! If you are a dev jump in.
