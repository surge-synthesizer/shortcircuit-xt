Shortcircuit XT is a sample-initiated instrument being actively developed by the Surge Synth Team.

In February of 2026, we were pleased to launch the beta version of Shortcircuit XT, which you can download here.

While the system still has some features to add to 1.0, we are confident the tool is useful and reader for wider
adoption. We are tracking our 1.0 book of work in github issues, but welcome feedback, testing, and comments from beta
users now.

If you use ShortCircuit a few things of note:

- You may want to use a limiter on the SC bus, in case there is a DSP error. Similarly exhibit caution with in-ear
  headphones. We think our DSP is bounded, but bugs happen.
- Most of the discussion about what works and doesn't happens on our discord. Please join!

  serves as a design guide for where we are going
- The more the merrier! Feel free to jump in.
