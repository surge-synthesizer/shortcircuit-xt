/**
 * The SCXT Next messaging model
 *
 * We want SCXT "engine" to be able to provide a JSON interface at its edge to
 * a consumer, but obviously we don't want those messages on the audio thread (all
 * that string allocation!! all that parsing time) but also we don't want to require
 * a UI thread to run (what if we want a headless server mode, or an HTTP interface!)
 *
 * So our messaging strategy ends up with three thread
 *
 * Engine Audio Thread
 *    - Runs ::process
 *    - Can't allocate memory
 *    - Cant use anything other than lock free data structures
 *
 * Engine Serialization Thread
 *     - Runs its own ::run
 *     - Can allocate
 *     - Can do read-only access to Engine memrory (same process as the audio thread)
 *     - Can use system mutex/cond var etc.. to communicate with anything other than audio
 *
 * Client Thread (aka UI Thread)
 *      - Can do wahtever it wants except...
 *      - Talk to the engine audio thread or engine data structures (separate memory)
 *
 * So that results in the following data structures
 *
 * Audio <-> Serialization
 *    - A pair of lock free queues called "serializationToAudio" and "audioToSeralization"
 *    - Fixed data structures only in audioToSerialization (no alloc)
 *    - If serializatToAudio has allocated structues, the engine hands them back for future freeing
 *    - Engine has an atomic bool (or perhaps int) of client connected (or client count)
 *
 *    in Engine::process
 *       - drain serializationToAudio and respond. These will almost exclusively be
 *         state mutation operators
 *       - send updates back. These will be things like noteon-off display indicates,
 *         parameter change displays and so on. Only do this if a client is connected.
 *
 * Client <-> Serialization
 *    - A queue locked by a mutex probably
 *    - A condition variable for queue mutation notifications
 *    - A callback function to send a response to the client which can be called
 *      from the serialization thread. (In the out-of-process model this would be
 *      a socket write most likely).
 *
 * Serialization::run
 *    - basically wait on the condition variable if the queues are emtpy
 *    - then drain the audioToSerialization queue and generate the associated outbound
 *      messages by calling the ui callback (but don't hold the lock while doing this)
 *    - The serialization thread blocks for inbound from the UI and
 *      does a check of the outbound thread every 50ms or so. If you
 *      want a faster outbound process send an idle wakeup message
 *
 * We encapsulate this in a few objects here.
 *
 * The MessageController is an object owned by the engine, constructed with an
 * engine. This is the object which can send messages between the various parts.
 * Those messages take a couple of forms
 *
 * Client <-> Serialization Messages (clients/client_serial.h)
 *
 * The pattern we use here is to make request and response objects. Request
 * objects are C2S and response are S2C, basically. There is a unique set of
 * IDs for each message.
 *
 * To be a C2S object you implement an object which has a constecxpr id c2s_id
 * and a typedef to c2s_payload_t. That payload should be json streamable (so
 * should be a basic type supported by jsoncpp or implement a traint in src/json).
 * Finally the object should implement static executeOnSerialization which is called
 * with a payload, an engine, and a controller. A client sends a message with
 * template<T> messaging::client::clientSendToSerialization(T &msg, MessageController &)
 * which uses these template properties to serialize the payload, deliver it to the
 * seralization thread, and execute it.
 *
 * To be an S2C object you do the inverse. Implement a constexpr s2c_id
 * and typedef an s2c_payload_t which again is json streamable. Then implement
 * template<Client> executeOnClient(Client *, s2c_payload &). This allows the
 * serialization thread to call MessageController::serializationToClient(s2cid, payload)
 * and have that delivered to the client for execution. Obviously the union of the
 * functions called on the Client template type by executeOnClient imply an API for
 * the client object which unpacks messages.
 *
 * Audio <-> Serlization Messages (audio/audio_serial.h)
 *
 * The audio thread messaging is more constrained since it has to be non allocating
 * and lock free. As a result the message payloads are fixed sized unions
 * AudiotoSerialization and SerializationToAudio, which you enqueue or
 * dequeue with a type for a switch.
 *
 * For the specific case of the serialization thread interacting with
 * the audio thread, though, we have used this mechanism to make a
 * fucntion callback which is audio-thread alloc free. The function
 * MessageController::scheduleAudioThreadCallback(cb) hides most of these
 * mechanics by sending a function to the audio thread with all of the
 * required allocation and deallocation happening on the serialization
 * thread.
 *
 * The other common pattern of the audio thread initiates a message is
 * really just done by explicitly constructing the message on the audio
 * thread, sending it, and then unpacking it in
 * MessageController::praseAudioMessageOnSerializationThread
 *
