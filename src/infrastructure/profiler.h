 * Code performance profiler (@rudeog)

 * called, the timestamp is popped from the stack and subtracted from the current
 * time. This effective elapsed time is added to the time stored in a bucket with the
 * same ID as is passed to the exit function. If other enter/exit pairs were pushed/popped
 * after the first enter call, their effective time is not counted in the effective time for
 * the first pair.
