.SH DESCRIPTION
Reads an AKAI media (i.e. from a CDROM drive, ZIP drive or directly from an
AKAI hard disk drive) or AKAI disk image file and extracts all its audio samples
as .wav files to the given output directory. If the given output directory does
not exist yet, then it will be created.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \ SOURCE
On Windows: drive letter of the source disk drive to read from. On POSIX systems
(i.e. Linux, Mac): path to the input source, which may either be an AKAI disk
image file already being available on your HD, or a disk drive path (i.e. '/dev/cdrom').
On Mac: You can omit this argument on Mac, which will cause it to access the
CDROM drive automatically ('/dev/rdisk1s0').
.TP
.B \ DESTDIR
Output path where all samples should be extracted to. If the directory does not
exist yet, then it will be created.

.SH "Author"
This program and its library are based on Sébastien Métrot's libakai. This is a
fork of libakai and its tools which is now also providing support for LINUX and
other POSIX compliant operating system, and it does not have a dependency to
libngl as the original libakai had. Linux port and man page written by
Christian Schoenebeck <cuse@users.sf.net>
