.SH NAME
sf2extract \- Extract samples from SoundFont version 2 (.sf2) files.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sf2extract
[ \-v ] SF2FILE DESTDIR [SAMPLENR] [ [SAMPLENR] ... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Extract samples from SoundFont version 2 (.sf2) files. All extracted samples
will be written in .wav format. You must at least supply name of the .sf2 input
file and an output path where all extracted samples should be written to.
By default
.B sf2extract
extracts all samples contained in the SoundFont file, even if they are not
linked by any instrument in the .sf2 file, but you can also extract only
particular samples by supplying a list of samples indices at the end of the
command line. You can use the
.BR sf2dump (1)
tool to see the list of available samples and their sample indices of a
SoundFont file.

.B Stereo Samples:
Note that stereo samples are always stored as pair of separate two mono samples
with Sound Font files. Keep that in mind when selecting individual samples by
index.
.BR sf2dump (1)
shows you which (mono) sample is linked to which other (mono) sample to form a
stereo sample pair.
.B sf2extract
automatically detects if one of the samples is part of a stereo pair and
automatically extracts the two as combined interleaved stereo sample data to the
output .wav file. Hence it is sufficient to pass the index of one of the
two (mono) samples of each stereo pair you want to extract.
