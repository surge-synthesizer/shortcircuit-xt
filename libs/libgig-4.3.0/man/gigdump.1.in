.SH NAME
gigdump \- List information about a Gigasampler (.gig) file.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gigdump
[OPTIONS] GIGFILE
.SH DESCRIPTION
By default it prints out a list of all available samples, real-time instrument
scripts and instruments within a Gigasampler (.gig) file, along with detailed
information about their properties and settings.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \ GIGFILE
filename of the Gigasampler file
.TP
.B \ --instrument-names
Only list instrument names and their index number.
.TP
.B \ --rebuild-checksums
Rebuild checksum table for all samples. Read description of
.B \ --verify
option for more details about sample checksums in general. Usually you only
need to use
.B \ --rebuild-checksums
in case the samples' CRC checksum table itself was damaged. The
.B \ --verify
option will tell you if that is really the case and will suggest to you to use
.B \ --rebuild-checksums
to repair the table in such cases. If only individual samples were damaged, you
rather might want to replace only those damaged samples with
.BR gigedit (1)
for example. Read description of 
.B \ --verify
for reasons to do so. When using
.B \ --rebuild-checksums
all checksums of all samples will be regenerated. Hence you should manually
check all samples once after using this option. That is by using your ears,
or by exporting the samples, but not by using the
.B \ --verify
option. Because the latter cannot identifiy damaged samples that have been
damaged before the entire checksum table had been regenerated.
.TP
.B \ -v
Print version and exit.
.TP
.B \ --verify
Check raw wave data integrity of all samples and print result of this check.
For all samples of a gig file a correspondig CRC32 checksum is stored along
to its raw wave form data whenever a conscious change to the wave form data
was performed. By calling gigdump with this option all samples are scanned
and compared with their existing checksums to detect any damage to
individual samples. The individual damaged samples are listed by gigdump
in this case. Since essentially the entire file has to be read, this can
take a long time and hence this check is not by default performed i.e.
each time a gig file is loaded for regular use for example. Accordingly you
may use
.B \ --verify
from time to time to check explicitly whether your gig files have been
damaged for some reason, i.e. after modifying them with an instrument editor
like
.BR gigedit (1).
In case damaged samples were found, you may replace those damaged samples with
.BR gigedit (1).
By doing this, only the replaced samples' checksums will be
updated. All other checksums remain untouched. That's why this approach is
recommended over using 
.B \ --rebuild-checksums
in such cases.
