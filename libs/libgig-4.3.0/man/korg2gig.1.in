.SH NAME
korg2gig \- Convert sound files from KORG to GigaStudio format.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B korg2gig
[\-v] [\-f] [--interpret-names] FILE1 [ FILE2 ... ] NEWFILE
.SH DESCRIPTION

This tool takes a list of KORG sound files, used with KORG synthesizer keyboards
like Trinity, Triton, OASYS, M3 or Kronos, and converts them to a
Gigasampler/GigaStudio (.gig) file. All input KORG files are merged to a single
(.gig) output file.

For each KORG "multi-sample" (.KMP) file a separate GigaStudio instrument will
be created in the output (.gig) file. KORG Sample (.KSF) files referenced by
such multi-sample (.KMP) files are automatically detected, loaded and written to
the output (.gig) file as well. Assignments of samples to keyboard regions,
sample loops and other minor articulation information are converted as well.
But note, the multi-sample (.KMP) form is very primitive. It does NOT save the
detailed articulation information of your KORG keyboard like envelopes, LFO
and filter settings. Those information are stored in a separate program (.PCG)
file.

Unfortunately there is no support for KORG's program/combinations/bank (.PCG)
files yet. Have a look at option
.B \ --interpret-names
for a workaround.
Because of this lack of support for .PCG files, you still have to adjust the
articulation settings in the output (.gig) file afterwards with an instrument
editor application like
.BR gigedit (1).

If you are explicitly passing KORG sample (.KSF) files as well, and they are not
referenced by any "multi-sample" (.KMP) file you might have passed, then those
orphaned samples are added to the output (.gig) file in a separate sample group
called "Not referenced". That way you can easily distinguish samples in the
output (.gig) file which are actually used by one of the instruments, and the
samples that are not used yet.

.B NOTE:
This tool might need quite a lot RAM at the moment. Approximately it will
allocate as much RAM as the expected output .gig file will be in size. So make
sure you have enough free RAM and/or swap space, otherwise this tool might
crash if it cannot allocate the required RAM space.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.B \ FILE1 [ FILE2 ... ]
A list of input KORG sound (.KMP or .KSF) files. You must supply at least one
KORG file. KORG sample (.KSF) files referenced in the so called "multi-sample"
(.KMP) file(s) are automatically detected and loaded. So in most cases you
would just pass .KMP file(s) as input file argument(s).

.TP
.B \ NEWFILE
Output file in Gigasampler/GigaStudio (.gig) format. If this output file
already exists,
.B korg2gig
will abort with an error message unless you specify
.B \ -f
as argument as well.

.TP
.B \ -v
print version and exit

.TP
.B \ -f
Overwrite output file if it already exists.

.TP
.B \  --interpret-names
Try to guess left/right sample pairs and velocity splits. This is a nasty
workaround for the fact that there is no support for reading KORG .PCG files
yet. If you manually named the multi-samples (.KMP files) on your keyboard in a
scheme like "PIANO 003-120 -R" it will interpret the two hints as a) velocity
split range (in this example from velocity 3 to 120) and b) stereo sample pairs
(in this case the multi-sample contains the right channel). Of course you can
also omit one or both hints if you don't want to have a velocity split or stereo
sample pair for certain instruments or regions.
