.SH "Author"
This program and its library are based on Sébastien Métrot's libakai. This is a
fork of libakai and its tools which is now also providing support for LINUX and
other POSIX compliant operating system, and it does not have a dependency to
libngl as the original libakai had. Linux port and man page written by
Christian Schoenebeck <cuse@users.sf.net>
